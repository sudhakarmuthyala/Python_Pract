# Python Practice for refresh 

## Day 1: A basic program to print a message

- Write the basic code in sample.py
```  
  vim sample.py
  print ("Hellow World!")
```
- Then execute the python script to know the output
```
- $ python sample.py

    Hellow World!
```
```
- Function is a set of tasks that can be done. We need to call functions. There are several functions in Python like the print() function.
- Round brackets are used with a function to pass a parameter in it.
- We can define our own functions as well.
```


## Day 2: A basic python program for operators and printer (addition, subtraction, devide & multiplication)

- We do addition, subtraction and multiplication with integer values, and then it gives us answers also in integer data type.
- But when performing division with integer values then it gives us an answer in float data type.
- Float stands for Floating Point Representation.

- Addition 
```
2+3
```
 Output 

```
5
```

- Subtraction 
```
9-5
```
 Output 

```
4
```
- Devide

```
5/2
```
 Output 

```
# Floating number
2.5 
```


- If you want to get only the quotient part or the integer part of the answer and want to neglect the decimal value, it can be done with the help of (//).
- // (double slash) is used for division when you want to return only an integer value in the answer.
- // is also called Integer Division or Floor Division.
- Devide


```

5//2
```
 Output 

```
#integer
2
```
- Multiplication

```
2*2
```
 Output 

```
4
```

- How to square a number in Python, you can use the ** Operator?
- Double asterisks (**) is used to find the power of a number. 
        number ** power =  2**2 = 2*2

```
2**2

```
 Output

```
4
```

- In Python, int and float are two distinct numeric data types used to represent different kinds of numbers.
  
**1. Definition:**
**int (Integer):**
Represents whole numbers, both positive and negative, without any fractional or decimal part. Examples include 5, -10, 0, 1000.

**float (Floating-Point Number):**
Represents real numbers that can have a fractional or decimal part. Examples include 3.14, -0.5, 1.0, 2.718


- To get the remainder, we use the modulus operator (%).

```
10%3
```
 Output 

```
1
```
